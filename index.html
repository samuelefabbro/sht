                        <p>It took us a while to plan this tour, since we wanted it to be the best, most varied and fascinating one in all of Venice. For this reason, we've been eating at both famous and little-known places for years. We selected the most iconic tastings in Venice - traditional dishes that our ‘nonna’ prepared for us. We're a group of friends born and raised in Venice, made up of food lovers and licensed tour guides.</p>
                        <p>During the tour, you can expect rustic, authentic food prepared with passion and love. The experience will last approximately 3 and a half hours, with an easy walk through little-seen parts of Venice.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>We'll make 5 stops, exploring a crescendo of fascinating flavors and stories. To keep it 100% local, it’s unfortunately not a tour for vegetarians, vegans, or those with lactose intolerance. But if you're in one of these categories, feel free to reach out so we can organize a "super-hungry" tailor-made private tour just for you.</p>
                        <p>There's a maximum of 10 participants per tour, with a gondola ferry to cross the Grand Canal, and a friendly, foodie tour guide. Excited? So are we. Go with your gut, and save a spot now!</p>

We're not taking you to eat “amatriciana” in Venice (because it was invented in Amatrice!), we want you to experience the real thing. Ready?</h3>

                  <h3>Baccalà Mantecato</h3>
                  <p>
                    You can really judge a restaurant by trying its Baccalà. It’s a codfish dish that's boiled and mixed only with sunflower oil. Creamy and yummy, it's served on toasted bread or - even better - polenta corn.

                  <p>
                    We love it! It's rustic, comforting and oh so satisfying. The beans are boiled together with bay leaf, rosemary and ham. For pasta, it's served with tagliatelle or ditalini and sprinkled parmesan.

                    Enjoy ladyfingers soaked in coffee and covered with yolk cream and mascarpone.<br>
                    Tirame-su means "lift me up." You’ll see why!
